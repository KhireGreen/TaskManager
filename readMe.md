The main issues that I faced was creating the local storage in an array. 
I went through various tutorials and code-alongs but still couldn't grasp the syntax
of how to implement it into my code.
I left the local storage code just in case if I was able to figure it out.
The process of how I went about this was setting up the HTML and CSS as a typical page
I began to create functional buttons out of the edit and delete button
To tell the difference of what mode you are in, the text changes colors
A lot of the javascript theory was hard to grasp.
